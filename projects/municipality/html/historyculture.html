                    With the "Kallikratis" program, which was established on January 1, 2011, Lamia merged with the pre-existing
                    Municipalities of Gorgopotamos, Leianokladi, Ypati and the community of Pavliani, and remained the seat of
                    the now enlarged Municipality of Lamia.

                <div class="historytext">
                    According to mythology, Lamia was built by Lamos, the son of Hercules and Omphalis.<br />
                    Another version is that it was built by Lamia, the Queen of Trachinia, daughter of Poseidon.<br />
                    The word "Lamia" is etymologically related to "laimos" or "lamos", which means gap, abyss or even insatiable,
                    greedy. It is known that a large and deep stream passed through the city. On the northeastern side of People's
                    Square, a deep gorge with running water was discovered during excavations for reconstruction. After all, its plane
                    trees are also indisputable witnesses. It is not excluded, then, that Lamia was named after this stream and its
                    many lamias (mythical creatures), who according to legend lived in those years in its dense vegetation.

                    urban fabric the trade, processing and professions that characterize urban development and evolution.
                    With a newer administrative reform after 1960, the Prefecture of Fthiotida and Fokida is divided and Lamia
                    is defined as the capital of the Prefecture of Fthiotida, while Amfissa is defined as the capital of the Prefecture of Fokida.<br />

                    Historical-archaeological research in the distant past highlights the long history of Lamia and other areas of
                    the Municipality as cities with a special administrative or commercial and communication role (Amfiktionia /
                    passage of Thermopylae in ancient times - Trade Center in Byzantium and the Ottoman period). The historical
                    investigation of the evolution of the Municipality and the city proves that Lamia has always been a regional
                    center with an important role in the development of the Greek area.<br />

                    In the period 1960-1980, the region of Lamia became a pole of decentralized policies (Establishment of the
                    Industrial Area of ​​Lamia) and with the self-government and regional reforms of the 1980s, the city became a
                    Regional Center, since it was defined as the seat of the Region of Central Greece and supported by the
                    corresponding infrastructure in the service sector.
